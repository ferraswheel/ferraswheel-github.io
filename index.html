			<p>Hello, my name is Sabrina and I am 25 years old. I have a passion for problem solving and helping others on my journey. I started off being a math major, then I took a computer science class and loved it so much I decided to make that my major. I also have taken a lot of graphic design classes for “fun” in between my rigorous math and physics classes. My interests include gardening, baking, and anything new in the math and computer world (I get really excited to learn new things). Below are a few projects I have done in my classes or internships. I am excited to further my software develpoment, coding, and web design skills as I work on more projects in the future.</p>

		<h4>This is my final project from my Software Design class at CSUMB</h4>
		<p>The powerpoint below, which I made with Microsoft's PowerPoint, shows the application I made. This app is made to be able to share and find pets who need a home. Throughout the app there are pop-ups indicating success or indicating that more information is needed. I used a few recycler views for some of the lists as well as utalizing Android Studio's SQLite to keep information of users, pets, requests, reports, and messages.</p>

		<h4>This is the website I was working on for Your Consulting Team-Edward Papp</h4>
		<p>I worked on making each page responsive. Being sure to have the font size get smaller, but not too small. Also getting the navigation buttons to line up the same on each page and transition well when the screen size shrinks. Got the background picture to look good when resizing as well. In additon I made some corrections to make sure all the pages were html5 compliant </p>

		<h4>This is the website Frequencies of Love-Destiny Lucas (resize browser to see responsiveness)</h4>
		<p>Some things I did for this project were updating the navigation bar, making the website html5 compliant, fixing a lot of the spacing issues, making picture of Destiny everywhere clickable and to indicate that it is, and updating the format of the Contact page with more style and space for Destiny's bio</p>
