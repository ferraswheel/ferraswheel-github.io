			<p>Hello, my name is Sabrina. I have a passion for problem solving and helping others on my journey. I am in my senior year at CSUMB to get my bachelorâ€™s in computer science with a focus on software development. Below are a few projects I have done in my classes or internships. I am also currently working as a teaching assistant (TA) for two classes: Introduction to Database Structures and Design & Analysis of Algorithms. Some of my hobbies are gardening, baking, and playing volleyball. I really enjoy learning new things, and I am excited to continue gaining more experience in software development, coding, and web design.</p>

		<h4>This is my final project from my Software Design class at CSUMB</h4>
		<p>The powerpoint below, which I made with Microsoft's PowerPoint, shows the application I made. This app is made to be able to share and find pets who need a home. Throughout the app there are pop-ups indicating success or indicating that more information is needed. I used a few recycler views for some of the lists as well as utilizing Android Studio's SQLite to keep and retrieve information of users, pets, requests, reports, and messages.</p>

		<h4>Live Websites</h4>

		<h4>This is the website Frequencies of Love-Destiny Lucas (resize browser to see responsiveness)</h4>
		<p>Some things I did for this project were updating the navigation bar, making the website html5 compliant, fixing a lot of the spacing issues, making picture of Destiny everywhere clickable and to indicate that it is, and updating the format of the Contact page with more style and space for Destiny's bio</p>

		<h4>This is the website I was working on for Your Consulting Team-Edward Papp</h4>
		<p>I worked on making each page responsive. Being sure to have the font size get smaller, but not too small. Also getting the navigation buttons to line up the same on each page and transition well when the screen size shrinks. Got the background picture to look good when resizing as well. In additon I made some corrections to make sure all the pages were html5 compliant </p>
